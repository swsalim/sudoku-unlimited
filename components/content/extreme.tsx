        <h1>Extreme Sudoku Puzzles – The Ultimate Test of Logic</h1>
        <p>
          Extreme Sudoku is for the absolute best solvers, removing up to{' '}
          <strong>65 numbers</strong> from the grid. With so few clues, standard techniques won’t be
          enough—you’ll need deep pattern recognition and high-level solving methods like{' '}
          <strong>Forcing Chains and Nishio</strong>. These puzzles require intense concentration,
          making them one of the toughest logic challenges you can face.
        </p>
        <h2>Strategies to Conquer Extreme Sudoku Puzzles</h2>
        <p>
          Extreme Sudoku solvers rely on techniques like <strong>Forcing Chains</strong>, where you
          track multiple possibilities in a chain reaction to see which leads to a contradiction.
          <strong>Nishio</strong> is another approach where you assume a number placement and follow
          the logic—if it results in a contradiction, you know the assumption was wrong. These
          techniques require time and effort, but solving an Extreme Sudoku is one of the most
          satisfying achievements for a true Sudoku expert!

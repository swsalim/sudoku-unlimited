          <strong>60 numbers removed</strong>, these puzzles demand careful planning and the use of

        <h2>Master-Level Sudoku Techniques to Succeed</h2>
        <p>
          At this level, techniques like <strong>XY-Wing</strong> become crucial. This method
          involves three cells that contain a specific set of possibilities, allowing you to
          eliminate certain numbers from surrounding cells. <strong>W-Wing</strong> is another
          powerful strategy, helping to spot pairs of numbers that force a certain chain of
          eliminations. These puzzles require patience and precision, but solving them is a
          rewarding experience for any Sudoku master.

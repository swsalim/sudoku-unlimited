        <h1>Medium Sudoku Puzzles – A Step Up in Challenge</h1>
        <p>
          Once you’ve mastered Easy Sudoku, it’s time to take on{' '}
          <strong>Medium-level Sudoku puzzles</strong>. These grids offer a bit more challenge by
          providing fewer starting numbers, requiring players to think ahead and apply more logical
          reasoning. While still approachable, Medium Sudoku encourages you to sharpen your skills
          and recognize patterns more efficiently. It’s the perfect difficulty for those looking to
          improve their game without diving into overly complex strategies.

        <h2>Smart Strategies to Solve Medium Sudoku Puzzles</h2>
        <p>
          To tackle Medium Sudoku efficiently, <strong>scanning and elimination</strong> should
          still be your go-to techniques, but you’ll also need to start looking for{' '}
          <strong>naked pairs and hidden singles</strong>. A <strong>naked pai</strong> occurs when
          two cells in a row, column, or box contain only the same two possible numbers—meaning
          those numbers can’t appear elsewhere in that section. <strong>Hidden singles</strong>{' '}
          require you to scan for a number that appears as an option in only one cell within a row,
          column, or box. As the puzzles get trickier, staying patient and methodical will help you
          solve them with confidence!
